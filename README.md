# Titanic EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival patterns.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)).
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values).
  - Visualizations (survival rates, age distribution, correlation heatmap).
  - Summary of insights.

## Files
- `titanic_eda.py`: Python script for the EDA.
- `*.png`: Visualization outputs (e.g., survival_count.png).
- `train.csv`: Titanic dataset (optional, downloadable from Kaggle).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
2. Place `train.csv` in the same directory.
3. Run the script: `python titanic_eda.py`.
4. View terminal output and saved PNG files.

## Key Insights
- First-class passengers had a higher survival rate.
- Females were more likely to survive than males.
- Younger passengers and those paying higher fares had better survival chances.
